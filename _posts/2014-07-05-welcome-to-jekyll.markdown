This is a test `Java` post. Just trying to understand the line width and font settings and how they get applied. It its
a pain to work in css. I am glad I never wanted to work in css/js/html crap. Anyways, lets hope that this get done well.

Below is some sample Java code. Not sure how it'll look but we'll know once we've it rendered.

{% highlight java %}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        System.out.println("It works!");
    }
}
#=> prints 'It works!" to stdout.
{% endhighlight %}

Now some `C++` code.
{% highlight c++ %}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        System.out.println("It works!");
    }
}
#=> prints 'It works!" to stdout.
{% endhighlight %}

Some `clojure` now.
{% highlight clojure %}
(defn foo [n]
    (println n))

{% endhighlight %}

# This is a test heading
