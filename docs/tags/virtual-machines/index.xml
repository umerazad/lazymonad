      <description>I recently came across an interesting opinion paper that posits &amp;ndash; modern VMMs are microkernels done right. Its a bit dated but a good read nonetheless. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but disagree with some parts of their claims. In all honesty, comparing VMMs to microkernels doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like an apples to apples comparison. I am summing up my thoughts for your instructive criticism.
Avoid Liability Inversion Their claim about microkernels having performance problems because of page evictions by user-space pagers is correct for the most part.</description>
