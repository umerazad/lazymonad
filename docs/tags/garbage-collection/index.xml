      <description>Disclaimer This post provides an intentionally watered-down overview of mark sweep garbage collection algorithm and the tradeoffs involved around it. A lot of the gory implementation details aren&amp;rsquo;t mentioned.
Recap At a high level, an automatic memory management system has two key responsibilities:
 Allocate space for new objects Reclaim space from dead objects  The sole responsibility of a garbage collector is to reclaim the space used by every object that will no longer be used by any of the execution paths in the program.</description>

      <description>TL;DR Stop reading if you&amp;rsquo;ve a computer with infinite memory.
In this series of blog posts, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over some well known garbage collection techniques and analyze the tradeoffs involved from the system design perspective. All the ideas are taken from existing literature and I am not making any claims of original work. Garbage collection is a subject that is very close to my heart, and by writing about it I hope to improve my own understanding of modern language runtimes.</description>
